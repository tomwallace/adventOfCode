This project is a Grails implementation of the Advent of Code puzzles, written by Eric Wastl.  You can find the puzzles (or could when I was working on them) at:

http://adventofcode.com/

Each day of Advent contained two puzzles.  I wrote a service for each day and included a Specification of tests for that day's puzzles.

You can find more code from me on my Github page:
